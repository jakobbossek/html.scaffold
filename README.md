html.scaffold
=============

Easy customisable responsive webdesign framework which I mainly use for my private projects. Comparable with Twitter Bootstrap, YAML and other popular frameworks but not so overloaded and as a consequence of small weight. Includes a regularize.css file adopting some ideas from normalize.css and Twitter Bootstrap.
